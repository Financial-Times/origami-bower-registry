			<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
			<p>
				To use the Origami Bower registry, update your <code>~/.bowerrc</code> file to
				the following:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="o-syntax-highlight--json">{
	"registry": {
		"search": [
			"https://origami-bower-registry.ft.com",
			"https://registry.bower.io"
		]
	}
}</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="o-layout-item">
			<h2 id="private-repository-listing">Private Repository Listing</h2>
			<p>
				This Bower registry can also list private repositories, but this is decided on a case-by-case
				basis. If you'd like to add your private repo to the white-list, then you'll need to
				consider the following first:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Although the repository itself will remain private, the <em>name</em> of it will
					become publicly viewable through the registry. Depending on the repo name, this
					may present a privacy concern for you
				</li>
				<li>
					Despite being listed, a Bower user may still not be able to actually install the
					module â€“ this will depend on their GitHub permissions. This could be confusing
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you're OK with the above then either <a href="mailto:origami.support@ft.com">contact the Origami team</a>
				asking to add your repository, or <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-bower-registry/blob/master/index.js">add it to the <code>privateRepoWhitelist</code> array yourself</a>
				and open a pull request.
