			<h1>Install Financial Times GitHub repositories as Bower components</h1>

			<p>
				The Origami Bower Registry is a Bower-compatible JSON API which lists all public
				repositories owned by the Financial Times as well as a
				<a href="#private-repository-listing">white-list of private repositories</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				To use the Origami Bower registry, update your <code>~/.bowerrc</code> file to
				the following:
			</p>

			<pre><code>{
	"registry": {
		"search": [
			"https://origami-bower-registry.ft.com",
			"https://bower.herokuapp.com"
		]
	}
}</code></pre>

			<h2 id="private-repository-listing">Private Repository Listing</h2>

			<p>
				The registry can also list private repositories, but this is decided on a case-by-case
				basis. If you'd like to add your private repo to the white-list, then you'll need to
				consider the following first:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Although the repository itself will remain private, the <em>name</em> of it will
					become publically viewable through the registry. Depending on the repo name, this
					may present a privacy concern for you
				</li>
				<li>
					Despite being listed, a Bower user may still not be able to actually install the
					module â€“ this will depend on their GitHub permissions. This could be confusing
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				If you're OK with the above then either <a href="mailto:origami.support@ft.com">contact the Origami team</a>
				asking to add your repository, or <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-bower-registry/blob/519900207a480dc4b2957d70fec88dcd1715f18c/index.js#L20-L22">add it to the whitelist yourself</a>
				and open a pull request.
