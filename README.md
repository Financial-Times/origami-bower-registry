======================

**:warning: This is a work in progress :warning:**

Requirements
------------

Running Origami Bower Registry requires [Node.js] 6.x and [npm].


Running Locally
---------------

Before we can run the application, we'll need to install dependencies:

```sh
make install
```

Run the application in development mode with

```sh
make run-dev
```

Now you can access the app over HTTP on port `8080`: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)


Configuration
-------------

We configure Origami Bower Registry using environment variables. In development, configurations are set in a `.env` file. In production, these are set through Heroku config. Further documentation on the available options can be found in the [Origami Service documentation][service-options].

### Required everywhere

  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`: The API key used to publish packages to S3.
  * `AWS_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key used to publish packages to S3.
  * `GITHUB_SECRET`: The secret used when communicating with the Github Webhooks.
  * `GITHUB_TOKEN`: The oauth token to use when communicating with the Github API.
  * `NODE_ENV`: The environment to run the application in. One of `production`, `development` (default), or `test` (for use in automated tests).
  * `PACKAGE_DATA_STORE`: The location of the JSON packages data that powers the service. This should be a URL.
  * `PORT`: The port to run the application on.
  * `S3_BUCKETS`: Comma-separated S3 bucket names to publish packages to.

### Required in Heroku

  * `CMDB_API_KEY`: The API key to use when performing CMDB operations
  * `FASTLY_PURGE_API_KEY`: A Fastly API key which is used to purge URLs (when somebody POSTs to the `/purge` endpoint)
  * `GRAPHITE_API_KEY`: The FT's internal Graphite API key.
  * `PURGE_API_KEY`: The API key to require when somebody POSTs to the `/purge` endpoint. This should be a non-memorable string, for example a UUID
  * `REGION`: The region the application is running in. One of `QA`, `EU`, or `US`
  * `RELEASE_LOG_API_KEY`: The change request API key to use when creating and closing release logs
  * `RELEASE_LOG_ENVIRONMENT`: The Salesforce environment to include in release logs. One of `Test` or `Production`
  * `SENTRY_DSN`: The Sentry URL to send error information to.

### Required locally

  * `GRAFANA_API_KEY`: The API key to use when using Grafana push/pull

### Headers

The service can also be configured by sending HTTP headers, these would normally be set in your CDN config:

  * `FT-Origami-Service-Base-Path`: The base path for the service, this gets prepended to all paths in the HTML and ensures that redirects work when the CDN rewrites URLs.


Adding Organisations
--------------------

In order for the Origami Bower Registry to crawl a GitHub organisation, you need to complete a few steps:

  1. Add the GitHub organisation name to the `githubOrganisations` array in [`index.js`](index.js)

  2. Set up an [organisation webhook](https://github.com/blog/1933-introducing-organization-webhooks):

      1. Navigate to `https://github.com/organizations/<YOUR-ORG>/settings/hooks`

      2. Click the **Add webhook** button

      3. Set the **Payload URL** to `https://origami-bower-registry.ft.com/packages/refresh`

      4. Set the **Content type** to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

      5. Set the **Secret** to a value given to you by the [Origami Team](#contact). (Ask them to give you access to the `Bower Registry GitHub Webhook Secret` LastPass note)

      6. Check the **Let me select individual events** radio

      7. Uncheck all of the event type checkboxes that appear, _except_ **Repository** â€“ which will alert the Bower Registry when a repository is created, deleted, publicised, or privatised

      8. Save the webhook by clicking the **Add webhook** button at the bottom of the page

  3. Celebrate!


Operational Documentation
-------------------------

The source documentation for the [runbook](https://dewey.ft.com/origami-bower-registry.html) and [healthcheck](https://endpointmanager.in.ft.com/manage/origami-bower-registry-eu.herokuapp.com) [endpoints](https://endpointmanager.in.ft.com/manage/origami-bower-registry-us.herokuapp.com) are stored in the `operational-documentation` folder. These files are pushed to CMDB upon every promotion to production. You can push them to CMDB manually by running the following command:
```sh
make cmdb-update
```


Testing
-------

The tests are split into unit tests and integration tests. To run tests on your machine you'll need to install [Node.js] and run `make install`. Then you can run the following commands:

```sh
make test              # run all the tests
make test-unit         # run the unit tests
make test-integration  # run the integration tests
```

You can run the unit tests with coverage reporting, which expects 90% coverage or more:

```sh
make test-unit-coverage verify-coverage
```

The code will also need to pass linting on CI, you can run the linter locally with:

```sh
make verify
```

We run the tests and linter on CI, you can view [results on CircleCI][ci]. `make test` and `make lint` must pass before we merge a pull request.


Deployment
----------

The production ([EU][heroku-production-eu]/[US][heroku-production-us]) and [QA][heroku-qa] applications run on [Heroku]. We deploy continuously to QA via [CircleCI][ci], you should never need to deploy to QA manually. We use a [Heroku pipeline][heroku-pipeline] to promote QA deployments to production.

You can promote either through the Heroku interface, or by running the following command locally:

```sh
make promote
```


Monitoring
----------

  * [Grafana dashboard][grafana]: graph memory, load, and number of requests
  * [Pingdom check (Production EU)][pingdom-eu]: checks that the EU production app is responding
  * [Pingdom check (Production US)][pingdom-us]: checks that the US production app is responding
  * [Sentry dashboard (Production)][sentry-production]: records application errors in the production app
  * [Sentry dashboard (QA)][sentry-qa]: records application errors in the QA app
  * [Splunk (Production)][splunk]: query application logs


Trouble-Shooting
----------------

We've outlined some common issues that can occur in the running of the Origami Bower Registry:

### What do I do if memory usage is high?

For now, restart the Heroku dynos:

```sh
heroku restart --app origami-bower-registry-eu
heroku restart --app origami-bower-registry-us
```

If this doesn't help, then a temporary measure could be to add more dynos to the production applications, or switch the existing ones to higher performance dynos.

### What if I need to deploy manually?

If you _really_ need to deploy manually, you should only do so to QA (production deploys should always be a promotion). Use the following command to deploy to QA manually:

```sh
make deploy
```
